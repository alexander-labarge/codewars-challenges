# This is my portfolio

function_test.py: Demonstrates while true loop with user input that only allows integers, for an arithmetic operation of addition. The result is then printed.

linear_regression_model.py: This is a module I wrote to achieve modeling for U.S. Energy Production utilizing the least squares linear regression modeling equation. It uses pandas to read an excel file, extract the data for plotting. Then the linear regression equation is deducted from the values. The user is then able to input either a year to determine U.S. Energy Production, or a production amount to determine by what year the U.S. will achieve the enery production amount.
